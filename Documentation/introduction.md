NOTE: DO NOT USE BOTH NPM AND YARN IN THE SAME FOLDER. USE ANY ONE OF IT

Throughout the course we will be using Yarn, however using NPM or Yarn is a personal choice. You can use this as a reference guide for the two different commands you can use. Don't worry if you are not sure of the below commands as we will explore them throughout the course:

**Install dependencies from package.json:** npm install == yarn

**Install a package and add to package.json:** npm install package --save == yarn add package

**Install a devDependency to package.json:** npm install package --save-dev == yarn add package --dev

**Remove a dependency from package.json:**npm uninstall package --save == yarn remove package

**Upgrade a package to its latest version:** npm update --save == yarn upgrade

**Install a package globally**: npm install package -g == yarn global add package
